      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a technology enthusiast</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from Southfield, Michigan</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love spending time with family and loved ones. I'm currently working on myself and spend a lot of time analyzing ways to improve my life along my path to mastery</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Ideally, I'd like to create my own apps and software, own rental properties and invest in businesses I believe in.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I just moved back to Southfield</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've always been interested in IT. I previously worked in the financial tech industry as a Business Analyst for a mortgage company where I worked closely with a team of QA's and Devs of all kind. I loved my job, but hated only being able to assist with testing when projects were running behind schedule. After leaning on the Devs for a year or so, I made up my mind to take my next big step by adding Developer to my skill set </p>
